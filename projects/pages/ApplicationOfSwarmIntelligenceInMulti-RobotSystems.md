The relatively expensive nature of the commercially available swarm robot packages made us realize that making them by ourselves is the better choice. Since the primary aim of this project is to create a swarm of robots that are capable of doing simple tasks like following a leader or finding a path by avoiding obstacles.

Technology can change with needs. So spending money on a particular technology can be a waste. Thus, it was decided to design and build customized robots that suit our purpose within this projectâ€™s first phase and later use them within the second phase.

The goal of the first phase is to create five working robots that are equipped with all the instruments and sensors that would help them survive and perform in a swarm environment. Within the second phase the robots that were made during the first phases were used to implement the swarm intelligence into them.

By using the library that was built during the second phase, we were able to communicate with
the robots and to use them to do a simple task like moving in the same direction while
communicating between each other.
