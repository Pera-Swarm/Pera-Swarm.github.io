The study delves into the realm of swarm robotics, where agents collaborate to efficiently explore and map unknown environments, emphasizing the reduction of redundancy and enhancement of system reliability and cost-effectiveness. Leveraging a mixed reality framework, the research integrates physical and virtual robots, employing swarm SLAM algorithms to refine exploration strategies.

Key advancements include the creation of cost-effective sensor-equipped robots and the development of decentralized communication protocols, significantly boosting the scalability and efficiency of multi-robot systems. Furthermore, weâ€™ve also developed novel algorithms specifically tailored for multi-robot systems, focusing on optimizing path planning, task allocation and coordination.
